# TicTacToe-JavaGUI

Utilizing Java Swing, this program creates a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a graphical user interface. The players get the choose how many players there are, the number of connections you need to win, and the size of the board.

Some of the files in this program are not used as this implementation was built on-top of an older version that did not utilize a GUI.

Boards that are of size 10x10 or smaller will run using an array to store the game board. Boards larger than this will run using a hash map to store the values of the game board.
